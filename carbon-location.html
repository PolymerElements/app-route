`carbon-location` is an element that provides synchronization between the
browser location bar and the state of an app. When created, `carbon-location`
elements will automatically watch the global location for changes. As changes
occur, `carbon-location` produces and updates an object called `route`. This
`route` object is suitable for passing into a `carbon-route`, and other similar
elements.

An example of the public API of a route object that describes the URL
`https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/carbon-route-converter?foo=bar&baz=qux`:

    {
      prefix: '',
      path: '/elements/carbon-route-converter'
    }

Example Usage:

    <carbon-location route="{{route}}"></carbon-location>
    <carbon-route route="{{route}}" pattern="/:page" data="{{data}}"></carbon-route>

As you can see above, the `carbon-location` element produces a `route` and that
property is then bound into the `carbon-route` element. The bindings are two-
directional, so when changes to the `route` object occur within `carbon-route`,
they automatically reflect back to the global location.

A `carbon-location` can be configured to use the hash part of a URL as the
canonical source for path information.

Example:

    <carbon-location route="{{route}}" use-hash-as-path></carbon-location>
